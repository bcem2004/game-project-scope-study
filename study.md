# Game Project Scope Study

## Required Readings

-   [Game Project](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project)
-   [Game API](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project-api)
-   [What is a User Story](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories)

## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like
- I have a hard copy that I will bring to class
-   The data structure you plan to use.
- The board will made using html and css using divs, classes and ids (I've also seen some tables used in my research...)
-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
- I think the gameboard will need to be represented by JS arrays, and a loop function will need to used when the user chooses a "box" on the gameboard.
-   How you plan to approach this project.
- I am going to use all of our documentation, the question queue. I will still need help, but feel I have a general understanding of how to go about the html, css, and javascript components. I am still very lost on the JSON and Ajax portions. I have requested a 1 on 1 for Monday to go over these topics. I need to try to remember to break things down as much as possible task by task. I will also commit as soon as I get something working with thorough commit messages.
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
    - As a player I to log in to my game account.
    - As a player I want to begin a new game.
    - As a player I want to know which player won or if the game was a draw.
    - As a player I want to be able to start a new game from the page I am on.
    -
-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
- I will have separate files for the html, css, and js and link where necessary. Although I need more help with understanding jquery-ajax, I know that separate files need to be continued for the different components (i.e. events, api.js, ui.js)
-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
  -  tbd, need to get through the basics first
-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
  - I will commit everytime I get code to work and create thorough commit messages. I will likey keep some handwritten notes, as well, as I work through how to create the code.
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
  - I don't think that is likely, but if there is time I will try.

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
